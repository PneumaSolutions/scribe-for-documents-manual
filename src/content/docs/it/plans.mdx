### On-Demand Remediation

On-demand remediation allows you to buy a single conversion. Its price is determined by the number of pages in the document.

Note that this option only appears when placing an order directly from the "Remediate Full Document" section.

### Prepaid Page Pack

A prepaid page pack gives you 100 pages at a significantly discounted rate compared to paying by the page. These page credits do not expire.

### Yearly Subscription

A yearly subscription offers 2500 page credits, as well as a 30% discount on human-remediation. These credits do not roll over.
