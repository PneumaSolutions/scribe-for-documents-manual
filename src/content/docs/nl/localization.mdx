Scribe currently ships with 8 major languages, with more being added over time. If your system locale is among the supported languages in Scribe, the user interface will use your chosen language.

### Switching languages

Scribe displays a language selector button at the bottom of the screen. Clicking this will display a list of languages. Select the desired language, and then click the "Switch language" button.  
Note that this language switcher will not change the default document remediation language set via the document defaults panel.
