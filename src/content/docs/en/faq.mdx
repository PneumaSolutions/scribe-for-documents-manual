Here are answers to some common questions concerning Scribe. When faced with an issue, please refer to this document whenever possible. Note that some of these questions concern Scribe's use throughout an organization.  
Don’t see your question? [Contact us](https://pneumasolutions.com/contact/), and let’s get you squared away.

### Why Scribe?

Before Scribe, print-disabled individuals faced barriers in accessing online documents. Scanned documents often remained inaccessible, and new formats didn’t cater to assistive technologies. Scribe, with its Augmented Document Remediation (ADR) technology, eliminates these challenges.  
Previously, document remediation was a costly, labor-intensive process, requiring human translation, tagging, and testing. Scribe’s ADR technology makes this unnecessary for most documents, saving time and money.  
Many organizations struggle to make their entire document library accessible. Ignoring the issue can lead to expensive litigation. Scribe swiftly provides high-quality, cost-effective accessible documents without human intervention.  
With Scribe, 100% of your documents are accessible 100% of the time, meeting the needs of print-disabled individuals

### What is the unique gap Scribe fills in?

Not every document requires costly human remediation for print-disabled access. Scribe bridges the gap for documents like invoices, financial statements, and more, which often remain inaccessible due to high costs. There is a shortage of certified human document remediators, creating a backlog of inaccessible documents.  
Scribe’s ADR technology reduces this backlog, providing nearly instant access for print-disabled individuals. For documents requiring human remediation, Scribe offers a cost-effective solution, providing certified remediated documents for under $10 per page.

### What is Augmented Document Remediation?

Scribe’s Augmented Document Remediation combines automated efficiency with human expertise to tackle complex documents. Our proprietary pipeline blends machine learning and heuristics to significantly reduce the need for manual intervention. When human remediation is necessary, it’s focused on refining output, creating a powerful solution for a wide range of materials.

### How much can Scribe save my organization?

The potential savings your organization can achieve with Scribe depend on several factors, including the number of documents you currently have online, the volume of documents you plan to provide in the future, and the extent of remediation needed.  
It’s important to consider that if your organization doesn’t offer documents in an accessible format, there’s a risk of litigation to consider.  
Manual document remediation typically costs between $15 to $20 per page. In contrast, Scribe can generate well-formatted alternative documents for just pennies per page. While we can’t provide an exact dollar amount of savings, the significant cost difference between Scribe and manual document remediation is evident.  
With Scribe, you also save valuable time by eliminating the need to upload individual documents for certified human document remediation quotes. Accessibility is achieved in seconds, and if a human-remediated version is necessary, users can easily request one with just a few clicks.  
Scribe streamlines the process, allowing you to provide accessible documents seamlessly in the background. To help you make an informed decision, we offer a fully functional trial. Simply [click here to initiate your trial](https://scribeit.io/) and experience the potential savings firsthand.

### How long is the trial period?

The trial period for Scribe is not constrained by a fixed number of days. Instead, you have the freedom to utilize Scribe to preview as many documents as you desire. The only restriction is an inability to remediate the full document.

### Does Scribe produce fully remediated documents?

Scribe is designed to produce highly accurate remediated documents through its unique Augmented Document Remediation technology. As a result, most documents no longer require certified human document remediation.  
Print-disabled individuals can promptly access the information they need directly from the accessible documents generated by Scribe, typically in a matter of seconds.  
Currently, Scribe’s Augmented Document Remediation technology achieves an average accuracy rate of 96%. Our developers continuously enhance its capabilities and machine learning functions to improve accuracy even further.

If your goal is to achieve a 99% accuracy level with certified human document remediation, we are more than willing to collaborate with your preferred remediation service. Alternatively, you can choose to work with one of our partners to reach this goal for less than $10 per page.  
Using a Scribe generated document as the source file for certified human document remediation reduces both cost and processing time.  
We invite you to explore the capabilities of Scribe through our free trial.

### Why does the remediated .PDF look like the original but all the other formats look different visually?

If you’re wondering why your document looks different after processed by Scribe compared to its original appearance, there’s a straightforward explanation.  
Scribe is meticulously designed to optimize every aspect of document display for maximum accessibility and usability, catering to users with various types of print impairments. It empowers users to easily customize font styles, text sizes, and colors, ensuring that the document is presented in a layout that’s easy to read, regardless of the user’s chosen font size. However, when it comes to Scribe’s PDF output, the primary goal is to preserve the original appearance of the document while still meeting accessibility requirements. This approach may make it less user-friendly for individuals with low vision who wish to customize the visual elements.  
Scribe’s PDF output aims to provide a single version of your document that is both accessible and identical in appearance to the original. If you encounter a situation where Scribe’s PDF output differs from the original, we consider it a potential issue and kindly request that you inform us about it. We are committed to continuously improving the accuracy and consistency of our PDF output to ensure it aligns closely with the original document.

### Doesn’t Scribe use the same OCR processing as other document processing?

Scribe sets itself apart by using AI and the most advanced and highest-quality OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools available today. It goes beyond standard OCR processing by incorporating additional graphic cleansing processes that may not be available in your organization’s current workflow.  
Scribe is unique in that it utilizes a proprietary technology called Augmented Document Remediation (ADR). ADR is specially designed to format your source document as it was originally meant to be read, providing an accessible output that preserves the document’s intended formatting and structure.  
Through machine learning algorithms, Scribe continually improves its performance over time, without the need for manual updates or additional configuration. Properly formatted source files processed by Scribe are readable using various technologies, specifically designed to assist print-disabled individuals.

### What's the difference between Scribe's ADR and traditional assistive OCR programs?

Scribe utilizes proprietary technology called Augmented Document Remediation (ADR) to transform documents into accessible formats. Here’s a simplified explanation:
* Traditional processes typically print documents to a file and attempt optical character recognition (OCR).
* Scribe’s ADR technology, on the other hand, goes beyond OCR. It intelligently extracts text from the document and employs a special graphical cleansing process to enhance content clarity.
* ADR incorporates machine learning to identify both tagged and untagged elements in the source document. For example, it can recognize headers, lists, tables, and various formatting elements even if they lack explicit tags or font attributes.
* Scribe’s machine learning analyzes the content to determine its specific use and format in the source document. Then, it swiftly transforms the content into an accessible document format in just seconds.
* Importantly, this entire process is automated, requiring no human intervention.
* Scribe also offers the capability for content producers to create custom document profiles or templates. This is particularly useful for documents with repetitive structures, such as invoices or statements, as it ensures consistent and efficient formatting every time.

In essence, Scribe’s ADR technology provides an advanced and automated way to make documents accessible without the need for manual intervention, and it can be further optimized using document templates for specific document types.

### How will documents be available to my end-users?

To make documents accessible to your end-users, all they need is a web browser. Here’s how it works:
1. You will receive a dynamic link from us, which you can embed into your website or content management system.
1. When your end-users click on this link, they will be presented with eight different accessible formatted document options.
1. Your end-users can choose the formats that work best for their adaptive equipment, making it easy for them to access the content.
1. Scribe produces documents that are compatible with various assistive technologies, including screen readers, screen and text magnification software, Braille displays or printers, and other audible, tactile, or digital technologies.

This means that your end-users can access the documents in a format that suits their specific needs and preferences, ensuring a seamless and accessible experience.

### Does Scribe handle multiple document types such as invoices, statements, reports, and account summaries?

Certainly, Scribe is versatile and can handle various document types such as invoices, statements, reports, and account summaries.

### How long does it take to Scribe a document?

The time it takes to Scribe a document can vary depending on the specific scenario:
* On-Demand Conversion (Cloud Service): When using Scribe’s cloud service for on-demand conversion, it takes just a few seconds for end-users to get the information they need with a single click.
* Library Conversion (Super Compute Cloud Infrastructure): If you are converting an entire library of documents, the time required will depend on the size of your library. Using Scribe’s Super Compute cloud infrastructure for dynamic conversions, it’s possible to convert thousands of documents in an afternoon or a day.
* On-Premises Installations: If you choose an on-premises installation and use your own network resources, the conversion time will depend on the performance of your network. It may take longer compared to the cloud-based Super Compute infrastructure.

In any case, once the document is converted, it will be available to end-users within seconds through a web browser, making it convenient and efficient for them to access the information they need.

### How long would it take to get a fully remediated document if we needed one?

The time it takes to get a fully remediated document, if needed, will depend on several factors, including the complexity of the document and the specific requirements for remediation. However, with Scribe’s Augmented Document Remediation (ADR) technology providing a highly accessible starting point, the process can be expedited:
* Highly Accessible Starting Point: Scribe’s ADR technology significantly reduces the need for extensive manual remediation. This means that the initial accessibility of the document is quite high.
* Certified Document Remediation Team: If certified human document remediation is necessary for documents that require 99% accuracy, such as legal documents or textbooks, Scribe can provide this service. The certified document remediation team will work on the document.
* Faster Processing: Thanks to the quality of the starting point provided by Scribe’s ADR technology, the certified document remediation team can process your documents more quickly than the standard time allowance.

The exact time frame for fully remediated documents will depend on the specific document and your organization’s requirements. However, Scribe aims to provide efficient and timely remediation services when necessary.

### What is the difference between dynamic and static accessible documents?

The difference between dynamic and static accessible documents lies in how they are generated and stored:
Dynamic Accessible Documents:
* These documents are converted on demand.
* Your source file remains on your network.
* When an end-user requests an accessible document, it is dynamically converted from the source file each time.
* This approach ensures that the document is always up-to-date and reflects any changes made to the source file.
* It is a “just-in-time” conversion process.

Static Accessible Documents:
* In this case, your entire library of documents has been converted into accessible formats.
* The converted documents, available in multiple formats, reside on your network.
* When an end-user requests an accessible version of a document from your website, it is downloaded directly from your library.
* These documents are pre-converted and stored for immediate access.
* It provides a quicker response to user requests but may require periodic updates if the source documents change.

The choice between dynamic and static accessible documents depends on your organization’s specific needs and preferences for document accessibility delivery.

### Wouldn’t I want to pay for converting our library one-time and be done with Scribe?

While converting your entire document library to accessible formats might seem like a one-time solution, it’s important to consider ongoing document creation and changes. Here’s why it’s not recommended to convert your library once and be done with Scribe:
* New Documents: As your organization continues to create new documents, they will also need to be made accessible. Converting your library one-time won’t address this ongoing need.
* Accessibility on Demand: To address new documents and changes to existing ones, you can utilize Scribe’s dynamic accessibility options like the Scribe Cloud Addition or Scribe On-Premises Addition. These plans allow you to generate accessible documents on-demand as needed.
* HIPAA and Security Concerns: If you have concerns about security and need to keep documents behind a firewall and on-site for compliance reasons, you can purchase a package of scribes that do not expire. This ensures that the accessible versions of your documents are available locally for users while maintaining security.

In summary, while converting your library is a valuable step, ongoing document creation and accessibility requirements make it necessary to have dynamic accessibility solutions in place, like those offered by Scribe, to meet the needs of your organization and users.

### What about security? Are documents safe to process on the cloud?

Security is a top priority for us at Pneuma Solutions. We have implemented robust security measures to ensure the safety of your documents when processing them in the cloud:
* High-Grade Encryption: We utilize the highest end-to-end encryption protocols available. This level of encryption is trusted by banks, medical institutions, and government organizations, ensuring that your documents remain secure throughout the process.
* VPN Technology: We employ Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology to establish secure connections for document uploads, processing, and returns to your platform. VPNs add an extra layer of security to protect your data during transmission.

With these security measures in place, you can have confidence that Scribe is committed to safeguarding your documents and sensitive information throughout the processing and delivery process.

### Our organization complies with HIPAA and client privacy standards. Is there an option to provide this service in-house?

Certainly! We understand the importance of complying with HIPAA and client privacy standards. To cater to organizations with strict privacy requirements, we offer the Scribe On-Premises Addition or desktop option. This option allows you to:
* Restrict Access: You can restrict access to Scribe from the public domain, ensuring that all conversions are performed within your in-house network.

### Does Pneuma Solutions keep any source or alternative format documents processed by Scribe?

Pneuma Solutions does not retain source or alternative format documents processed by Scribe long-term or permanently. However, we do temporarily cache the encrypted versions for 72 hours as part of our processing service. If you require adjustments to this caching period, you have the option to increase it or have it removed entirely. You can configure this setting in your account settings for your convenience.

###Is Scribe only for blind and visually impaired people?

Scribe is not exclusively for blind and visually impaired individuals. It is designed to assist anyone with a print disability. A print-disabled person is defined as “a person who cannot effectively read print due to a visual, physical, perceptual, developmental, cognitive, or learning disability.” Scribe aims to make information accessible to individuals with various forms of print disabilities, ensuring that a wide range of users can benefit from its services.

### Does Scribe help people with dyslexia?

Yes, Scribe can be beneficial for individuals with dyslexia. It offers various formats, including DAISY, Epub, and audio formats, which can assist people with dyslexia in accessing and comprehending content. The DAISY option, for example, allows individuals with dyslexia to listen to the document while following along visually in print, providing them with an alternative way to consume information. The natural-sounding text-to-speech audio format used by Scribe can make content more accessible to individuals with dyslexia by providing them with an alternative way to access and comprehend written information.

### So, what gives? Where does Scribe currently have some limitations?

Scribe’s Augmented Document Remediation technology is designed to transform inaccessible printed material into highly accurate and usable document formats. However, like any technology, it does have some limitations as it continues to learn and improve its capabilities. Here are the known limitations of Scribe:
* Images without alternate tags:
    * Scribe automatically adds descriptions to images that lack alternate text tags.
    * The automatically generated descriptions may not always be perfect or may be generic, depending on the complexity of the image.
* Multilingual documents:
    * Scribe attempts to detect the language of each text block in the document.
    * Language detection may sometimes be incorrect, especially for very short text blocks.
    * Scribe does not perform fine-grained language detection within a single paragraph containing multiple languages.
* Uncommon typographical conventions:
    * Scribe attempts to tag all document headings for efficient navigation with assistive technology.
    * In cases where the document formatting deviates significantly from common conventions, Scribe may report heading text as a false positive or miss a heading.
* Complex tables:
    * Scribe aims to tag all document tables, but in complex page layouts, some tables may be missed or incorrectly tagged.
    * It may not accurately detect header cells, cells spanning multiple columns or rows, or properly distinguish between cells in complex tables.
* Running OCR on scanned documents:
    * When Scribe needs to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on a scanned document, the OCR results may not be perfect, with an accuracy rate of about 95% as of the last update.
* Visual format preservation:
    * Scribe’s primary goal is to make content accessible to print-disabled users, and it may sacrifice formatting accuracy in some cases.
    * While it preserves font sizes, colors, indentation, and text justification, it does not retain finer details of page layout, such as margins, vertical spacing, headers, footers, or page breaks.

It’s important to note that Scribe’s focus is on accessibility and providing information to print-disabled individuals efficiently. For preserving the original formatting, it’s recommended to keep the original document version alongside the accessible versions generated by Scribe, as Scribe may not perfectly preserve all visual formatting details.

### Does Scribe convert math, Nemeth Code, or music notation?

As you’ve discovered in this FAQ, Scribe is a highly potent and rapid digital document remediation tool. However, there is a current limitation in digital remediation technology when it comes to accurately processing mathematical equations, music scores, tablature notation, or any form of music notation in Braille or print.  
The intricacies of these formats, including special characters and the unique nature of their composition, have not yet been fully integrated into OCR and machine learning technology. However, it’s essential to note that this doesn’t rule out the possibility of such capabilities in the future.  
For now, we encourage you to explore our certified human document remediation options to determine if they can address your specific needs.
