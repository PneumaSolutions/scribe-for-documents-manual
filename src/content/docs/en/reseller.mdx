If your organization is set up as a reseller, you will see a Reseller Dashboard in the navigation menu of your account's landing page. This dashboard will allow you to manage the child organizations under your organization.  
Once you're on the dashboard, you will be given an overview of how many credits are in your main account, as well as how many have been transferred.

### Adding an organization

Before you can transfer credits, you'll need to add a child organization. Click the "Add organization" link to begin the process.  
When adding an organization, you will be required to provide its name, the domain, and the email of the primary contact person. You may optionally add the primary contact person's first and last name. After setting the language of the organization, click "Save".  
Note that Scribe for Documents will not automatically email the primary contact person. The system assumes that you, as the main account holder, are handling communications with the primary contact person of the organization to whom you are reselling. Thus, you will need to contact them regarding their new account.

### Managing Organizations

Once you've added at least one child organization, you will see a "Customer Organizations" section with a list of the organizations under your umbrella. Click on an organization to manage it.   

#### Managing Credits

You may add or remove page credits from the organization by clicking the respective links to do so. When adding or removing page credits, you will be asked to enter the desired amount via the spin control. Once the action is completed, you will be given a breakdown of how many credits the child organization now has, vs. the amount of credits that are remaining in your main account.  

#### Trials

Clicking the "Start a Trial" link will allow you to initiate a trial period for your child organization. When granting a trial period, you will be asked for the amount of pages you would like to deposit into the organization's account, as well as the length of the trial period. Set the values to your liking, then click the "Add Pages" button to complete the activation process.  
A trial can last up to 30 days, either initially or by way of extension. You may deposit up to 200 pages free of charge, that is, they will not be pulled from the credit balance of your account. Any pages that exceed this threshold will be pulled from your account balance, however, any unused pages will be deposited back into your account when the trial period expires. Let's say, for instance, you grant a child organization a 15 day trial with 500 pages. If that organization uses 300 pages and is left with 200 by the time their trial expires, then their remaining 200 pages will be deposited back into your account.  
Should you wish to extend an organization's trial, you may do so via the "Extend Trial" link. however, you can only extend it up to the 30 day total.

### Page Credit Timeframes

The expiration dates of the page credits for your account, as well as those of your child organizations, are determined by your reseller agreement.  
Any trial with a credit count that exceeds 200, thus withdrawing credits from your account, will refund any unused credit back to your organization's main account upon expiration.
