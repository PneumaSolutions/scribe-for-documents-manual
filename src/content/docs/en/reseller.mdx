If your organization is set up as a reseller, you will see a Reseller Dashboard in the navigation menu of your account's landing page. This dashboard will allow you to manage the child organizations under your organization.  
Once you're on the dashboard, you will be given an overview of how many credits are in your main account, as well as how many have been transferred.

### Adding an organization

Before you can transfer credits, you'll need to add a child organization. Click the "Add organization" link to begin the process.  
When adding an organization, the name, domain, and email of the primary contact person are required. You may optionally add the primary contact person's first and last name. After setting the language of the organization, click "Save".  
Note that Scribe for Documents will not automatically email the primary contact person. The system assumes that you, as the main account holder, are handling communications with the primary contact person of the organization to whom you are reselling. Thus, you will need to contact them regarding their new account.

### Managing Organizations

Once you've added at least one child organization, you will see a "Customer Organizations" section with a list of the organizations under your umbrella. Click on an organization to manage it.   
From here, you may add or remove page credits from the organization by clicking the respective links to do so. When adding or removing page credits, you will be asked to enter the desired amount via the spin control. Once the action is completed, you will be given a breakdown of how many credits the child organization now has, vs. the amount of credits that are remaining in your main account.  
Note that the expiration date of your and your child organizations' page credits is dependent on your service agreement. IN the event you are providing a trial for a child organization, you will simply have to manually remove the page credits you allocate to them on a designated date.
