### Introducing Scribe for Documents

Thank you for choosing Scribe for Documents for your document remediation needs. Scribe for Documents is a cross-platform, affordable, one-click solution to on-demand document remediation!

Gone are the days of expensive, platform-specific, difficult to maintain remediation solutions. Through the power of machine learning and the cross-platform capabilities brought about in web2.0, Scribe takes document remediation to the cloud of near limitless possibilities.

#### Why Scribe?

If you're coming from an older document remediation package, you may be wondering how an upgrade to Scribe can benefit you.

##### Say Goodbye to Platform Lock-in

Most stand-alone document remediation packages are only available for the Windows platform, with macOS and mobile users left behind. What happens when you need to remediate a document and you're away from your desktop?

With previous solutions, you would be pretty well dead in the water until you get back to your computer. With Scribe being a fully web-based application, all it takes is a simple login and a file upload to generate a near instant result!

##### Fully modernized Conversions

Scribe is aligned with the latest document and web content accessibility standards, ensuring fully compliant accessibility.

##### Future Proof

Many document remediation packages would come shipped to you on a CD-ROM with lots of data, and the only available downloads would be update patches. With most computers not having a CDRom drive anymore, these solutions are already behind. Scribe addresses this by skipping the need for a downloadable application altogether. This cuts down on the need to follow a manual update process as Scribe improves. And improve it does, thanks to the power of machine learning!
