Remediating a document through Scribe is an extremely simple and efficient procedure.
1. Visit [scribeit.io](https://scribeit.io)
1. For best results, we recommend logging in before remediating a document. Click on the "Log in" link.
    1. Enter your email address. You will receive an email with a verification link that will log you in.
1. Once logged in, there are two ways to send a document to Scribe
    1. Click on the "File Browseâ€¦" button, locate the file on your computer, then click the "Start" button on the Scribe webpage.
        1. Supported filetypes include PDF, jpg, png, docx, or any other file that can stand on its own, I.E. is not dependent on additional components. As such, html files are not supported.
    1. Enter the URL of the document, then press enter or click on the "Preview" button.
        1. Note that this must be the URL to a direct file download, I.E. a URL that ends with a file extension such as .pdf, .jpg, etc. Scribe does not support URL's for  protected downloads that require login information. Protected files must be downloaded manually and then uploaded to Scribe.
1. Once the document is loaded, you will be presented with the first two pages of the document, or the entire document if you have credit.
    1. Note that the entire document goes through what is known as a streaming conversion, which means that the document's content will gradually fill the page until the conversion is complete.
1. Below the document content, you will find a "Remediate Full Document" button. Activating this button will allow you to select a conversion format via a menu, as well as customize conversion settings that depend on your chosen format. Regardless of conversion format, the basic conversion settings allow you to determine whether a document should have image descriptions generated, or whether or not to have math content converted into accessible MathML. The available conversion formats include:
    * Accessible webpage viewed directly on Scribe
    * Tagged PDF
        * Supports large print
    * MP3, via text-to-speech in about a dozen languages
        * Additional settings for dialect, voice and/or gender, and speaking rate are offered with this conversion.
    * Braille
        * Grade 1 (EBAE)
        * Grade 2 (EBAE)
        * Unified English Braille (UEB)
        * and many other languages
    * Downloadable web page
    * EPUB
    * Microsoft Word
        * Supports large print and language dialect options
    * DAISY, text plus audio
        * Additional settings for voice and speaking rate are offered with this conversion.
    * MOBI
1. Once you have selected your format and configured any additional settings for the chosen format, do one of the following:
    1. Activate the "Next: Pricing Options" button to begin the payment process.
        * You can choose to buy a subscription, a prepaid page pack, or a single on-demand remediation. The [Plans and Purchasing](../plans) section will cover the plans in more detail.
    1. If you already have a subscription or account credit, activate the "Convert" button to begin the automated remediation process. 

That's all there is to it! The final landing page will usually offer a download link to your file within seconds. Certain remediations, however, may take more time to process. This is standard issue for audio and daisy conversions due to the generation of the text to speech, however this may also happen if the document being remediated is quite large. In these cases, you can either leave the page open and wait for the link to appear, or look for an email to arrive with your file downloads.  
On this landing page, you can convert the document to another format. However, the initially chosen format will not show up in the list of format options as that format has already been used.

#### Text to speech conversion

Scribe for Documents features an extensive, natural text-to-speech system, offering unprecidented control over how your audio conversions are presented. When you select the DAISY or Audio conversion options, the speech options will appear upon pressing "Customize Settings".
The available settings are as follows:
* Language
* Gender: When the language is set to automatically detect, you are able to choose whether the document is read with a male, female or neutral voice.
* Dialect: Upon choosing a specific language, several dialect options become available.
* Voice: Each dialect comes with several voices to choose from. The "Play Sample" button allows you to instantly generate a sample of the chosen voice.
* Speech Rate: 1X, 1.5X, and 2X options are available

When a document is converted into any of the speech-supporting formats, an estimated time to completion will begin to display once the process reaches the speech conversion stage. Note that this time is merely an estimate, and the actual time to completion may vary based on a number of factors. As such, the actual time may be faster than the estimate, but every effort has been made to ensure Scribe does not underestimate the time to completion.

##### Note on Multilingual voices

The multilingual voices have been found to occasionally change language completely unprompted. In other words, if you have a document using only one language, with no indications of the need to switch languages, the multilingual voices may still decide to switch on their own for no clear reason. This is unfortunately a known issue beyond our control. As such, for documents known to be single-language, we recommend using the single-language voices for best results. These voices will still provide extremely natural inflection, but will not run the risk of unexpectedly switching languages.

#### Remediating Math content

Scribe for Documents offers the ability to convert print math content into an accessible format that can be read via speech and Braille. The resulting format will be the web-friendly MathML specification. MathML is readily supported by all modern web browsers, as well as most, if not all screen readers. These include:
* NVDA: via the free [MathCAT](https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/MathCAT.en.html) addon
* JAWS: built-in support via Direct embedding of the MathCAT library
* VoiceOver: Built-in support
* ChromeVox: Built-in support

Follow these steps to remediate a document containing math content:
1. Choose your desired conversion format.
1. Click the "Customize Settings" button.
1. Check the "Process mathematical notation (beta)" checkbox.
1. Make any further setting adjustments, then click "Convert".

The resulting output will include the mathematical notation rendered in a fully accessible format.

### Accessing Documents on a Later Date

Once logged into your Scribe account, a "Previously Scribed Documents" section will display the documents that you have already remediated. Clicking on one of them will pull up its preview along with any existing conversion downloads.
