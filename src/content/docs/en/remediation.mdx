Remediating a document through Scribe is an extremely simple and efficient procedure.
1. Visit [scribeit.io](https://scribeit.io)
1. For best results, we recommend logging in before remediating a document. Click on the "Log in" link.
    1. Enter your email address. You will receive an email with a verification link that will log you in.
1. Once logged in, there are two ways to send a document to Scribe
    1. Click on the "File Browseâ€¦" button, locate the file on your computer, then click the "Preview" button on the Scribe webpage.
    1. Enter the URL of the document, then press enter or click on the "Preview" button.
        1. Note that this must be the URL to a direct file download, I.E. a URL that ends with a file extension such as .pdf, .jpg, etc. Scribe cannot provide login information for a protected download. Protected files must be downloaded manually and then uploaded to Scribe.
1. Once the preview is ready, you will be presented with the first two pages of the document.
1. Below the preview, you will find a new section of the page denoted by the "Remediate Full Document " heading. Here is where you can select a conversion format, along with a "Customize Settings" expandable button that will offer conversion settings that depend on the chosen format. The available formats include:
    * Accessible webpage viewed directly on Scribe
    * Tagged PDF
        * Supports large print
    * MP3, via text-to-speech in about a dozen languages
        * Additional settings for voice and speaking rate are offered with this conversion. To expand them, click the "Customize Settings" button.
    * Braille
        * Grade 1 (EBAE)
        * Grade 2 (EBAE)
        * Unified English Braille (UEB)
        * and many other languages
    * Downloadable web page
    * EPUB
    * Microsoft Word
        * Supports large print
    * DAISY, text plus audio
        * Additional settings for voice and speaking rate are offered with this conversion. To expand them, click the "Customize Settings" button.
    * MOBI
1. Once you have selected your format and configured any additional settings for the chosen format, do one of the following:
    1. Activate the "Next: Pricing Options" button to begin the payment process.
        1. You can choose to buy a subscription, a prepaid page pack, or a single on-demand remediation. The Plans and Purchasing section will cover the plans in more detail.
    1. If you already have a subscription or account credit, activate the "Convert" button to begin the automated remediation process. 

That's all there is to it! The final landing page will usually offer a download link to your file within seconds. Certain remediations, however, may take more time to process. This is standard issue for audio and daisy conversions due to the generation of the text to speech, however this may also happen if the document being remediated is quite large. In these cases, you can either leave the page open and wait for the link to appear, or look for an email to arrive with your file downloads.  
On this landing page, you can convert the document to another format. However, the initially chosen format will not show up in the list of format options as that format has already been used.

### Accessing Documents on a Later Date

Once logged into your Scribe account, a "Previously Scribed Documents" section will display the documents that you have already remediated. Clicking on one of them will pull up its preview along with any existing conversion downloads.
